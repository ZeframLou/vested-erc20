# VestedERC20

A wrapper ERC20 token that linearly vests an underlying ERC20 token to its holders.

It's not really suited for trading, but it is a useful tool for plugging vesting into other primitives. One example is [Astrodrop](https://astrodrop.xyz), which is a tool for airdropping ERC20 tokens and more. Combining VestedERC20 with Astrodrop, one can airdrop vested tokens to arbitrarily many people for a constant cost.

## Local development

VestedERC20 uses [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) as the development framework.
